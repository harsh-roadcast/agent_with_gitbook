response_preview: '{"answer_markdown": "## Direct Answer\nBolt supports two primary
  types of billing models within its enterprise wallet system: Centralized Billing
  and Decentralized Billing. These models define how funds are managed and allocated
  across parent organizations and their child branches.\n\n## Key Details\n- In the
  Centralized Billing Model, the Parent Organization acts as the \"Bank,\" sharing
  a single pool of funds among all Child Branches. Child Branches can perform transactions
  even without individual budgets if the Parent Wallet has a balance [1].\n- In the
  Decentralized Billing Model, each branch operates as a siloed entity, maintaining
  its own budget and financial transactions independently [1].\n\n## References\n[1]
