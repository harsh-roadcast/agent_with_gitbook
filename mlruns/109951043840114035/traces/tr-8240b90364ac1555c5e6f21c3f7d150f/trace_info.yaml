  in Bolt focuses on optimizing turn-around time (TAT) for vehicles entering and exiting
  a facility. It assigns a purpose to each vehicle, tracks dock activity, and incorporates
  an approval matrix for gate events, all aimed at improving operational efficiency.\n\n##
  Key Details\n- Every vehicle entering the yard is assigned a purpose such as Inward
  Goods, Outbound Dispatch, or Empty movement to streamline operations [1].\n- The
  system tracks how long a vehicle stays at a specific dock for loading or unloading,
  providing precise dock activity monitoring [1].\n- An approval matrix allows for
  digital authorization from supervisors for gate-in or gate-out events, ensuring
  controlled access [1].\n- The TAT Gauge visualizes average gate-to-gate times to
  help yard managers monitor and improve facility efficiency [1].\n\n## References\n[1]
