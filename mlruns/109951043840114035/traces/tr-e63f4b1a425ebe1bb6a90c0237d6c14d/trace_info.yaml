response_preview: '{"answer_markdown": "## Direct Answer\nBolt supports two primary
  billing methods through its internal Wallet system: the Centralized Billing Model
  and the Decentralized Billing Model. In the Centralized model, a Parent Organization
  acts as the bank, pooling funds for all Child Branches. In the Decentralized model,
  each branch manages its own budget independently [1].\n\n## Key Details\n- Centralized
  Billing Model: The Parent Organization holds a single wallet balance shared by all
  Child Branches, allowing transactions even if individual branches have no budget
  [1].\n- Decentralized Billing Model: Each branch operates as a siloed entity, maintaining
  its own wallet and budget [1].\n\n## References\n[1] Billing & Enterprise Wallet
