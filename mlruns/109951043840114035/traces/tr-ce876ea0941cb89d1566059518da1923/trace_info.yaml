  focuses on optimizing the turn-around time (TAT) for vehicles entering and exiting
  a facility. It involves assigning a purpose to each vehicle, tracking dock activity,
  and managing approvals for gate-in and gate-out events to streamline operations.\n\n##
  Key Details\n- Every vehicle entering the yard is assigned a trip purpose such as
  Inward Goods, Outbound Dispatch, or Empty movement [1].\n- The system tracks how
  long a vehicle stays at a dock for loading or unloading to monitor efficiency [1].\n-
  An approval matrix allows digital authorization from supervisors for gate-in or
  gate-out events, ensuring controlled access [1].\n- The TAT Gauge visualizes the
  average time from gate entry to exit, helping optimize yard operations [1].\n\n##
