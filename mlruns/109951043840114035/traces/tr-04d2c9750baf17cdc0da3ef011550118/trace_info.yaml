response_preview: '{"answer_markdown": "## Direct Answer\nBolt supports two types
  of billing models: Centralized Billing and Decentralized Billing. In the Centralized
  Billing Model, the Parent Organization acts as the bank, sharing a single pool of
  funds across all Child Branches. In the Decentralized Billing Model, each branch
  operates as an independent entity and must maintain its own budget for transactions
  [1].\n\n## Key Details\n- Centralized Billing allows Child Branches to perform transactions
  even without individual budgets, as long as the Parent Wallet has funds [1].\n-
  Decentralized Billing requires each branch to manage its own funds independently,
  with no shared pool [1].\n\n## References\n[1] Billing & Enterprise Wallet Logic
