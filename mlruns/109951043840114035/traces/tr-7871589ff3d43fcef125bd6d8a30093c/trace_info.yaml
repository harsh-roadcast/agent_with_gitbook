  different configurations primarily categorized as centralized and decentralized
  billing modes. These modes affect how funds are managed and transactions are processed
  within the platform.\n\n## Key Details\n- In centralized billing, if a local balance
  is zero, the system automatically charges the Parent Wallet, allowing the purchase
