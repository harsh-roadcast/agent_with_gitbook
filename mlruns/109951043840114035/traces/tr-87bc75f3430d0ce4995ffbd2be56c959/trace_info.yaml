  to the system that manages financial transactions through an internal Wallet system.
  It supports two enterprise billing models: Centralized, where a Parent Organization
  acts as the bank for all child branches, and Decentralized, where each branch manages
  its own funds independently [1].\n\n## Key Details\n- In the Centralized Billing
  Model, all child branches share a single pool of funds, allowing transactions even
  if a child branch has no individual budget, as long as the Parent Wallet has a balance
  [1].\n- In the Decentralized Billing Model, each branch is a siloed entity and must
  maintain its own funds; transactions fail if the local balance is zero [1][2].\n-
  The system automatically handles fund deductions based on the billing configuration,
  charging the Parent Organization in centralized mode or blocking transactions in
  decentralized mode if funds are insufficient [2].\n\n## References\n[1] Billing
