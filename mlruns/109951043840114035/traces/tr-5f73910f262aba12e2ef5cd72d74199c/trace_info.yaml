  need to use your unique username and password associated with your organization.
  The system also requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) or a one-time password
  (OTP) sent via your registered email or SMS for added security.\n\n## Key Details\n-
  Access is secured by a multi-layered protocol including credentials and MFA/OTP
  verification [3].\n- If your account is suspended, all active sessions are instantly
  invalidated using a session versioning strategy [3].\n- After authentication, you
  may need to select your workspace or context to proceed [3].\n\n## References\n[3]
