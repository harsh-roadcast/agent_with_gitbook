  to the system that manages financial transactions through an internal Wallet system.
  It supports two enterprise billing models: Centralized, where a Parent Organization
  acts as the bank for all child branches, and Decentralized, where each branch manages
  its own funds independently.\n\n## Key Details\n- In the Centralized Billing Model,
  all child branches share a single pool of funds from the Parent Wallet, allowing
  transactions even if a child branch has no individual budget [1].\n- In the Decentralized
  Billing Model, each branch is a siloed entity and must maintain its own balance;
  transactions fail if the local balance is zero [1][2].\n- The system automatically
  deducts funds from the Parent Wallet in centralized mode when a child branch has
  zero local balance, but blocks transactions in decentralized mode under the same
  condition [2].\n\n## References\n[1] Billing & Enterprise Wallet Logic — https://roadcast.gitbo...'
