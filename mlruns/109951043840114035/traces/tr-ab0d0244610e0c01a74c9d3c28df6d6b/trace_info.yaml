response_preview: '{"answer_markdown": "## Direct Answer\nYard management refers to
  the operational process of managing vehicles and their activities within a facility''s
  yard to optimize turn-around time (TAT). It involves assigning purposes to vehicles,
  tracking dock activities, and implementing approval workflows to ensure efficient
  loading, unloading, and movement.\n\n## Key Details\n- The primary goal of yard
  management is to optimize turn-around time (TAT) for vehicles entering and exiting
  the facility [1].\n- Every vehicle must be assigned a trip purpose such as Inward
  Goods, Outbound Dispatch, or Empty movement [1].\n- Yard management tracks how long
  a vehicle stays at a specific dock for loading or unloading [1].\n- It includes
  an approval matrix where gate-in or gate-out events require digital authorization
  from a supervisor [1].\n- A TAT Gauge visualizes the average gate-to-gate time to
  monitor efficiency [1].\n\n## References\n[1] Yard & Warehouse Management | Documentation
