response_preview: '{"answer_markdown": "## Direct Answer\nYard management in Bolt
  refers to the module designed to optimize the turn-around time (TAT) of vehicles
  entering and exiting a facility. It involves assigning a purpose to each vehicle,
  tracking dock activity, and managing approval workflows for gate-in and gate-out
  events to streamline operations.\n\n## Key Details\n- Every vehicle entering the
  facility is assigned a trip purpose such as Inward Goods, Outbound Dispatch, or
  Empty movement to categorize its activity [1].\n- The system tracks how long a vehicle
  stays at a specific dock for loading or unloading, helping to monitor and improve
  efficiency [1].\n- An approval matrix allows for custom workflows where gate-in
  or gate-out events require digital authorization from a supervisor, ensuring controlled
  access [1].\n- The Turn-Around Time (TAT) Gauge visualizes the average gate-to-gate
  time, providing a key performance indicator for yard operations [1].\n\n## References\n[1]
