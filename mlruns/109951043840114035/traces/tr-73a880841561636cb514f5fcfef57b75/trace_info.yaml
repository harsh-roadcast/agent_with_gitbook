response_preview: '{"answer_markdown": "## Direct Answer\nBolt supports two types
  of billing models within its enterprise wallet system: Centralized Billing and Decentralized
  Billing. In the Centralized model, the Parent Organization acts as the bank, sharing
  a single pool of funds across all child branches. In the Decentralized model, each
  branch operates as an independent entity with its own budget and wallet [1].\n\n##
  Key Details\n- Centralized Billing allows child branches to perform transactions
  even without individual budgets, as long as the Parent Wallet has funds [1].\n-
  Decentralized Billing requires each branch to maintain its own wallet balance; transactions
  fail if the local balance is zero [1][3].\n- The system automatically deducts funds
  from the Parent Wallet in Centralized mode but blocks transactions in Decentralized
  mode if funds are insufficient [3].\n\n## References\n[1] Billing & Enterprise Wallet
