  (EV) registrations by state for the latest quarter. This is a reporting-related
  query that fits within the scope of the assistant''s responsibilities, which include
  generating insights and summaries based on vehicle data using Elasticsearch schemas.
  The repeated identical queries in the conversation history indicate the user is
  emphasizing or retrying the same request, possibly awaiting a detailed summary or
  visualization. The assistant should interpret this as a request to aggregate and
  present EV registration data by state for the most recent quarter available in the
  dataset. The query is straightforward and does not require breaking down into multiple
  sub-queries since it is a single reporting request focused on a specific metric
  (EV registrations) and dimension (state) for a defined time period (latest quarter).",
