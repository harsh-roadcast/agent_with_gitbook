It merges real-time visibility, configurable workflows, and deep reporting into a single web experience.\nWho it’s for\n:\nProduct Owners: orchestrate programs, configure roles, and align KPIs.\nPortal Operators: run daily operations—devices, trips, notifications, incidents, yard logistics.\nPublic Consumers: securely access shared trackers or dock data with read-only insight.\nWhy it matters\n: Reduce operational blind spots, standardize compliance, and respond faster to exceptions through location-aware dashboards, AI-assisted insights, and granular alerting.\nhashtag\nSystem Philosophy: Organization-First Architecture\nBolt V2 has fundamentally shifted from a user-centric model to an\nOrganization-Centric architecture\n.\nAsset Ownership:\nIn this system, assets (vehicles, geofences, devices) are owned by an\nOrganization\n, not an individual user. If a user leaves a company, the assets remain tied to the organization node.\nThe Hierarchical Tree:\nSuper Parent (Roadcast):\nThe root node with \"God Mode\" access. Roadcast manages global plans, hardware masters, and platform-wide configurations.\nParent Organization:\nThe primary client entity (e.g., a logistics company).\nChild Branches:\nSub-entities or regional offices that inherit settings from the Parent but can maintain operational isolation.\nhashtag\nThe Organization Tree\nThe structure of Bolt V2 is built as a recursive tree, ensuring that permissions and billing can be managed at scale.\nStructure Hierarchy:\nLevel 0: Roadcast (The Root)\nAccess\n:\nPlatform Administration.\nResponsibility\n:\nCreating standard plans, onboarding enterprise clients, and managing hardware masters (IMEIs, SIMs).\nLevel 1: Enterprise Parent (Client Level)\nAccess\n:\nOrganization Admin.\nResponsibility\n:\nManaging the master wallet, creating internal user roles, and configuring global geofences.\nLevel 2: Child Branches / Regional Hubs\nAccess\n:\nBranch Manager / Operations.\nResponsibility\n:\nDay-to-day dispatch, yard management, and driver assignments.\nInheritance Logic:\nPermissions:\nRoles created at the Parent level are automatically available to all Child branches.\nData Visibility:\nParents can view all data from their Children; however, a Child branch is isolated and cannot see sibling or parent data.\nBilling:\nIf an organization is created without a designated parent, it is automatically nested directly under the\nRoadcast\nroot.\nhashtag\nLearn more about Bolt V2\n#insert video\nNext\nGetting Started\nchevron-right\nLast updated\n21 days ago", "crawled_at": "2026-01-13T10:34:24.855750+00:00"}

The goal is to provide a clean, high-performance interface that prioritizes data visibility.\nManagement Hub Approach:\nThe interface is split into two distinct modes:\nAdmin Side (Roadcast):\nDesigned for high-density data management, bulk configurations, and global oversight.\nClient Side:\nDesigned for operational speed, featuring simplified menus focused on tracking and day-to-day logistics.\nConsistency:\nEvery page follows a standard layout: a collapsible\nNavigation Sidebar\non the left, a\nContextual Navbar\nat the top, and a dynamic\nWorkspace\nin the center.\nhashtag\nThe Contextual User Journey\nThe most important UX principle in Bolt V2 is\nOrganization Context\n.\nWorkspace Awareness:\nThe top navbar always displays the name of the active Organization. This is a constant visual reminder that the data being viewed is limited to that specific branch or parent.\nSlide-Out Workflows:\nTo prevent \"context loss,\" the app avoids excessive page jumping. When you click on a vehicle or trip, a\nSide Panel\nslides out from the right. This allows users to view details or edit settings while still keeping the primary map or list visible in the background.\nhashtag\nSmart Interaction Components\nWe use a set of custom components to handle complex data entry and display tasks simply.\nForm Generator:\nInstead of hard-coded forms, Bolt V2 uses a schema-based generator.\nValidation:\nForms provide instant feedback (e.g., matching passwords, valid IMEI formats).\nRequirement Indicators:\nFields marked with a red asterisk are mandatory for the backend logic to process.\nGeneric Table System:\nAll data lists (Users, Vehicles, SIMs) use a high-performance grid.\nBulk Actions:\nUsers can select multiple rows to perform actions like \"Bulk Suspension\" or \"Assign to Group.\"\nSkeleton Loading:\nWhile data is being fetched from the GraphQL server, the UI displays grey \"shimmer\" placeholders to prevent the screen from looking empty or broken.\nhashtag\nVisual Feedback & System Health\nThe platform uses color and motion to communicate state without requiring the user to read long messages.\nStatus Toasts:\nSmall notification boxes appear in the corner to confirm actions:\nGreen:\nSuccess (e.g., \"License purchased successfully\").\nOrange:\nWarning (e.g., \"Wallet balance is low\").\nRed:\nError (e.g., \"403: You do not have permission to view this section\").\nMap Marker Logic:\nVehicle icons on the map use a traffic-light color system (Green/Yellow/Red/Grey) to indicate engine and connection health instantly.\nhashtag\nHardened Security UX (PRD Case 9.3)\nSecurity is woven into the user experience through \"Session Versioning\" and strict access logic.\nPermission-Based Visibility:\nIf a user’s role does not allow \"Delete\" access, the delete button is\ncompletely removed\nfrom the UI, not just greyed out. This reduces clutter and prevents unauthorized attempts.\nForce-Logout Interaction:\nIf an administrator suspends a user while they are logged in:\nThe next interaction the user makes will trigger a\nSecurity Modal\n.\nThe modal informs the user that their session is no longer valid.\nThe user is automatically redirected to the Login page.\nImpersonation Indicators:\nWhen an Admin uses the \"Impersonate\" feature, the UI adopts a distinct visual highlight (often matching the client’s brand colors) to signify that the Admin is acting on behalf of a client.\nhashtag\nMobile & Field Optimization\nThe\nGuard View\nis a specific UX module designed for high-glare, outdoor environments.\nHigh Contrast:\nLarge buttons and high-contrast text make it readable on mobile devices in sunlight.\nIntegrated Scanning:\nThe UI provides a one-tap access to the device camera for scanning QR codes, eliminating the need for manual typing of long serial numbers.\nPrevious\nAdministration & Governance\nchevron-left\nNext\nCore Operational Logic & Expected Behaviors\nchevron-right\nLast updated\n14 days ago", "crawled_at": "2026-01-13T10:34:27.989793+00:00"}

Since the permission is missing, the system kills the request and displays a\n403 Forbidden\nscreen.\nhashtag\nSecurity & Session Scenarios (Case 9.3)\nSecurity protocols are hard-coded to prioritize data integrity over active sessions.\nThe Suspension Flow:\nTrigger:\nAn Admin marks a user (e.g., a Driver) as\nSuspended\n.\nLogic:\nThe system updates the\nSessionVersion\nin the central database.\nAction:\nThe user's current JWT (JSON Web Token) is invalidated.\nResult:\nNormal Case:\nThe user is kicked to the login screen on their next click.\nOn-Trip Case:\nThe Driver App terminates the session immediately. The vehicle's active trip is handed over to the\nTripHub\nfor supervisor management to prevent \"Ghost Trips.\"\nhashtag\nForensic Audit Pattern\nTo maintain enterprise accountability, every sensitive action in the system is logged using a standardized forensic string. This allows for deep auditing during security reviews.\nStandard Log Format:\nUser [ID] performed [ACTION] on Target [ID] at [TIMESTAMP]\nImpersonation Note:\nIf an action is performed while an Admin is \"Logged in as\" a client, the log is appended with the\n[PERFORMED_BY_IMPERSONATOR]\ntag. This ensures that client-side changes can be traced back to administrative intervention.\nhashtag\nEnterprise Readiness & Success Criteria\nFor large-scale enterprise deployments, the following scenarios must be validated to confirm a successful setup.\nValidation Area\nSuccess Scenario (Test Case)\nExpected System State\nOnboarding\nFull Enterprise Client Creation\nAdmin can successfully create an Org, map Users, and assign Roles in one sequence.\nFinancial API\nAutomated Billing Handshake\nCentralized/Decentralized flows function without manual backend intervention.\nSecurity API\nReal-time Blacklisting\nSuspended users cannot make ANY API calls, even if their token has not physically expired.\nData Continuity\nTripHub Handover\nActive trips continue logging data to the backend even if the driver's frontend session is killed.\nEnterprise Note:\nThese criteria ensure that Bolt V2 can be handed over to a client as a \"Ready-to-Use\" environment.
